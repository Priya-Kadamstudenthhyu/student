# Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project predicts flight ticket prices based on various parameters such as airline, source, destination, number of stops, and duration using machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- NetworkX / DGL (for GNN)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Streamlit (optional, for UI)

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation using RMSE, RÂ² Score
- Comparative study between ANN and GNN performance
